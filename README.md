# Segmentation Using ResNet26 with Depth-Wise Separable Convolution and Squeeze-and-Excitation Blocks

The project focuses on developing efficient segmentation models using the ResNet26 architecture enhanced with depth-wise separable convolutions and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks. The aim is to balance computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy while reducing model size. Four models are implemented: a baseline ResNet26, a ResNet26 with depth-wise separable convolutions, a pruned version of the depth-wise separable model, and a combined model integrating both depth-wise separable convolutions and SE blocks. The models are trained and evaluated on Cityscapes using advanced optimization techniques to ensure practical applicability in resource-constrained environments.
